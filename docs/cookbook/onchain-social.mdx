title: Onchain Social
---

In this guide, you'll discover the world of onchain social applications and learn how to build interactive Mini Apps that live directly inside social feeds, creating seamless user experiences without traditional platform limitations.

## What Is Onchain Social?

Traditional social media follows a familiar but limiting pattern: users sign in with email addresses, scroll through centralized feeds, and click links that redirect them away from the conversation. While this model works, it has fundamental limitations that onchain social aims to solve.

### The Onchain Social Paradigm

Onchain social represents a fundamental shift in how we think about digital identity and social interactions:

**Traditional Model Problems:**
- Your identity, content, and interactions are owned by the platform
- Building requires working on top of platforms, never inside them
- Users must leave conversations to access new experiences
- Developers are limited by platform APIs and restrictions

**Onchain Social Solutions:**
- **Portable Identity**: Your Farcaster ID (FID) belongs to you, not locked to any single platform
- **Embedded Experiences**: Rich, interactive apps run natively inside posts and conversations
- **Developer Freedom**: Build as first-class citizens within the social graph
- **User Ownership**: Control your data, content, and social connections

<Info>
This isn't about replacing existing platforms—it's about removing the walls between users, developers, and the experiences they create together.

## Mini Apps: The Interface for Onchain Social

Mini Apps are lightweight, expressive web applications that live directly inside social feeds. They launch instantly without installation and provide rich, interactive experiences that respond to your onchain identity.

**What makes Mini Apps special:**
- **Embedded experiences** that don't redirect users away from conversations
- **Social context awareness** - they know who opened them and from where
- **Onchain identity integration** with automatic personalization
- **Native feel** within social platforms

**Use cases include:**
- Interactive polls and real-time voting
- Social games and entertainment
- E-commerce with instant checkout
- DeFi interfaces and portfolio management
- NFT showcases and trading
- Collaborative decision-making tools

<Tip>
Mini Apps offer developers direct access to social distribution - you're building inside the conversation, not trying to pull users away from it.

## Build Your First Mini App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install MiniKit and Create Your Project">
    The fastest way to build a Mini App is with MiniKit, which handles authentication, social context, and onchain integrations automatically.

    **Create a new Mini App:**
    ```bash
    npx create-onchain --mini
    cd your-mini-app-name
    npm install
    ```

    **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    <Check>
    Your Mini App should now be running at `http://localhost:3000` with a fully functional social interface.
    </Check>

    **What you get out of the box:**
    - Complete frontend and backend scaffold
    - Built-in support for Farcaster identity and notifications
    - Native integrations with Base blockchain and OnchainKit
    - Responsive design optimized for mobile social feeds
    - Development tools for testing and debugging

    <Tip>
    The MiniKit scaffold includes example components and pages to help you understand the architecture quickly.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understand Social Context">
    Mini Apps have access to rich social context that traditional web apps lack. This context makes personalization effortless and enables intelligent interactions.

    **Access user and social context:**
    ```tsx
    import { useMiniKit } from "@coinbase/onchainkit/minikit";

    export default function App() {
      const { context } = useMiniKit();

      // Verified user information (always available)
      const userFid = context?.user?.fid;
      
      // Additional user data (when available)
      const username = context?.user?.username;
      const displayName = context?.user?.displayName;
      const pfpUrl = context?.user?.pfpUrl;

      // Client information
      const isAdded = context?.client?.added; // Whether user has added this Mini App
      const location = context?.location; // Where the Mini App was launched from

      return (
        <div className="mini-app">
          <h1>Welcome{displayName ? `, ${displayName}` : ''}!</h1>
          <p>Your FID: {userFid}</p>
          {username && <p>Username: @{username}</p>}
          {isAdded && <p>✅ You've added this Mini App</p>}
          {location && <p>Launched from: {location}</p>}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    **Verified context properties:**
    - **User identity**: FID (always available), username, display name, profile image URL
    - **Client status**: Whether the user has added your Mini App to their favorites
    - **Launch context**: General location information about where the Mini App was opened
    - **Safe area insets**: For proper mobile layout within Farcaster clients

    <Warning>
    Always handle cases where context might be undefined, especially during development and testing.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build Interactive Features">
    Create engaging social experiences that leverage the Mini App's embedded nature:

    **Example: Social Voting App**
    ```tsx
    import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
    import { useMiniKit } from "@coinbase/onchainkit/minikit";

    export default function VotingApp() {
      const { context } = useMiniKit();
      const [votes, setVotes] = useState({ option1: 0, option2: 0 });
      const [userVote, setUserVote] = useState(null);

      const handleVote = async (option) => {
        if (userVote) return; // Prevent double voting

        // Submit vote to your backend
        const response = await fetch('/api/vote', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
          body: JSON.stringify({
            fid: context?.user?.fid,
            option,
            location: context?.location
          })
        });

        if (response.ok) {
          setUserVote(option);
          // Update vote counts
          setVotes(prev => ({
            ...prev,
            [option]: prev[option] + 1
          }));
        }
      };

      return (
        <div className="voting-app">
          <h2>What's your preference?</h2>
          
          <div className="vote-options">
            <button 
              onClick={() => handleVote('option1')}
              disabled={userVote}
              className={userVote === 'option1' ? 'selected' : ''}
            >
              Option A ({votes.option1} votes)
            </button>
            
            <button 
              onClick={() => handleVote('option2')}
              disabled={userVote}
              className={userVote === 'option2' ? 'selected' : ''}
            >
              Option B ({votes.option2} votes)
            </button>
          </div>

          {userVote && (
            <p>Thanks for voting! Your choice: {userVote}</p>
          )}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    <Tip>
    Use the user's FID to prevent duplicate votes and create personalized experiences without requiring separate authentication.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Onchain Integration">
    Enhance your Mini App with blockchain functionality using OnchainKit:

    ```tsx
    import { 
      Transaction, 
      TransactionButton, 
      TransactionStatus 
    } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/transaction';

    export default function OnchainMiniApp() {
      const { context } = useMiniKit();
      
      const handleTransaction = async () => {
        // Create transaction based on social context
        const txData = {
          to: '0x...',
          value: '1000000000000000000', // 1 ETH
          data: '0x...'
        };
        
        return txData;
      };

      return (
        <div className="onchain-mini-app">
          <h2>Onchain Social Action</h2>
          <p>Initiated by FID: {context?.user?.fid}</p>
          
          <Transaction
            calls={[handleTransaction]}
            onSuccess={(receipt) => {
              console.log('Transaction successful:', receipt);
            }}
          >
            <TransactionButton text="Execute Onchain Action" />
            <TransactionStatus />
          </Transaction>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    <Check>
    Your Mini App can now trigger blockchain transactions directly from social interactions.
    </Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy and Test Your Mini App">
    Deploy your Mini App to make it accessible within social feeds:

    **Deploy to Vercel (recommended):**
    ```bash
    npm install -g vercel
    vercel --prod
    ```

    **Test your Mini App:**
    1. **Local testing**: Use the MiniKit development tools
    2. **Frame testing**: Test as a Farcaster Frame
    3. **Social testing**: Deploy and test in actual social contexts
    4. **Performance testing**: Ensure fast loading in mobile environments

    <Warning>
    Always test your Mini App in actual social contexts before broad deployment, as the social environment can affect performance and user experience.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
